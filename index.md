# Bento Box Discovery

--

### What

<b>Proposal</b>
- the UMD Libraries should evaluate adoption of Bento Box Discovery
- Bento Box is not a particular technology, but a style of discovery

--

### What

Bento is a style of Japanese boxed meal with compartmentalized portions

### What

<b>Search Flow</b>
- begin with single search box
- results compartmentalized into boxes by source or resource type
- link out to the native interface 

-- 

### What

--

### Why

<b>Currently no true single search</b> 
- single search can’t happen without aggregation of data from multiple sources into single index
- WorldCat Discovery covers much, but not all

--

### Why

<b>Metasearch solution hasn’t worked</b> 
- single search box with federated search and real-time aggregated result list
- shown to be too slow, poor search interface and capabilities, poor vendor support

--

### Why

<b>Provide users with single search box</b> 
- one starting point, obviates need to know the data source up front
- search results guide users to relevant sources and resource types
- retain native interface, which provides optimized display, navigation, and advanced search for the source data

--

### How

<b>Technology</b>
- local system executes multiple searches against source system APIs, but does not attempt to aggregate the results
- results presented as they are available
- open-source tools available, eg:
	- [QuickSearch](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/reports/quicksearch), provided by North Carolina State University
	- [VuFind](https://vufind-org.github.io/vufind/), provided by Villanova University

-- 

### How

<b>Evaluation process</b>
- explore publications and peer institution experiences
- begin with prototype systems for internal evaluation
- move to pilot and beta systems for end user feedback
- ensure data collection and review process in place from the start
